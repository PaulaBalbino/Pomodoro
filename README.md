# ‚è≥ Chronos Pomodoro

Chronos Pomodoro is a simple yet effective web-based Pomodoro timer designed to help you stay focused and productive by using the **Pomodoro Technique**, a time management method that breaks work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks, ending with a long break pause.

This project taught me a lot about React. Despite its apparent simplicity, it uses advanced concepts like adapters, reusable components, context, routing, and web workers, all in a clean and readable structure.


## üöÄ Features

- Start, interrupt, and reset a customizable Pomodoro timer
- Set custom durations for focus and break periods
- Switch between light and dark modes
- Track full history of cycles (completed, interrupted or dropped)
- Audio alert when the timer ends
- History can be sorted by task name, duration or date
- Clean and responsive UI, using Toastify for alerts
- Built using modern React features like Context API, Reducers, and Web Workers


## üì¶ Stack & Tools

- JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML5 and CSS3
- React: SPA application using Context API, Reducers, Web Workers
- Deployed with **Vercel**

There is no need for the user to keep the application tab open, they can work on other tasks while the countdown continues running, and the remaining time will be displayed on the tab.

In case the user tries to insert a number outside the range the system shows an alert:
